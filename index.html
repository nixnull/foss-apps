<title>The FOSS App List</title>

<h1>What is this?</h1>

Basically, a list of free no-strings-attached apps for your phone. No ads, no subscriptions. Made by people simply because they felt like it should exist.

<h1>Why do I care?</h1>

Most obviously, it's a better experience. Nobody is selling you anything, nobody is locking features behind paywalls.

But also, FOSS is anticapitalist, it's decentralized, and it's community based. FOSS is made by individuals or small groups that just wanted to make something they cared about, that felt useful to people. If they stop or lose interest, someone else can pick up the project. Our entire software ecosystem could be this way.

<h1>Won't this be inferior to paid apps?</h1>

No. Every app on this list has 4 or more stars. Try them yourself.

Capitalism encourages software to be limited (unless paid for), and constantly be replaced with "better" versions. FOSS survives purely on functionality. If it's useful, it floats to the top. If something does it better, it's replaced or integrated. There's no motive to limit the quality or functionality.
